    <h2>Why C2M2?</h2>
    <p>Prior to starting his library career, C2M2 mad scientist and creator Michael
      Harris completed a doctorate in musicology with a dissertation on Japanese
      film music of the post-World War II era. Although his professional life has
      shifted into the world of library and archives, he nonetheless continues to
      work within the field of film music studies, giving papers, collaborating with
      colleagues on projects, and in general associating with the community in both
      the professional and personal spheres. In his research and that of his
      colleagues, identifying and using archival resources has proved
      challenging.</p>
    <p>Currently a great deal of film music research is rooted in close analysis of
      performed music within a media text (for example, longitudinal studies of the
      corpus of a single composer, looking at film and music practices in the
      context of a limited period and a single studio, or the use of music and sound
      by a single director), which make the film/show/game/media and its audiotrack
      the core objects under consideration. Archival materials are only used when
      they happen to be available and easily discoverable, which is extremely
      unusual. This is the problem that C2M2 attempts to address.</p>
    <p>Archives of media music are dispersed across many repositories including
      libraries, private collections, and the massive archives of specific studios.
      The Collections of Cinema and Media Music, or C2M2 (similarity to R2-D2 not
      accidental), hopes to become a multi-repository collaboration to assist
      archives in making their film music collections more discoverable to the
      researchers who seek them. This project hopes to utilize ideas from Helen
      Samuelsâ€™ documentation strategy approach to build a robust record via
      collaboration between archives and the film and media music industry. And
      through this, we also hope to raise the visibility of women and minority
      composers and those working in non-Hollywood film industries.</p>
